name: Google Task Queue
description: The Task Queue API lets applications perform work, called tasks, asynchronously
  outside of a user request. If an app needs to execute work in the background, it
  adds tasks to task queues. The tasks are executed later, by scalable App Engine
  worker services in your application.
