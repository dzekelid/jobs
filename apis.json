Transferring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be as little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed Internet.With Snowball, you don&rsquo;t need to write any code or purchase any hardware to transfer your data. Simply create a job in the AWS Management Console and a Snowball appliance will be automatically shipped to you*. Once it arrives, attach the appliance to your local network, download and run the Snowball client to establish a connection, and then use the client to select the file directories that you want to transfer to the appliance. The client will then encrypt and transfer the files to the appliance at high speed. Once the transfer is complete and the appliance is ready to be returned, the E Ink shipping label will automatically update and you can track the job status viaAmazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), text messages, or directly in the Console.Snowball uses multiple layers of security designed to protect your data including tamper-resistant enclosures, 256-bit encryption, and an industry-standard Trusted Platform Module (TPM) designed to ensure both security and full chain-of-custody of your data. Once the data transfer job has been processed and verified, AWS performs a software erasure of the Snowball appliance.",

Amazon Pinpoint helps you understand user behavior, define which users to target, determine which messages to send, schedule the best time to deliver the messages, and then track the results of your campaign.Targeted push notifications based on app usage trends and user behavior have become a popular approach for mobile app user engagement because response rates are often several times higher than tradition email marketing campaigns. By using targeted push notifications, you can increase message relevance and effectiveness, measure engagement, and continually improve your campaigns.Getting started with Amazon Pinpoint is easy. First, AWS Mobile Hub guides you through the process to integrate the AWS Mobile SDK with your app. Next, you define your target segments, campaign message, and specify the delivery schedule. Once your campaign is running, Pinpoint provides metrics so you can run analytics and track the impact of your campaign.With Amazon Pinpoint, there are no upfront setup costs, and no fixed monthly cost. You only pay for the number of users your campaign targets, the messages you send, and the events you collect, so you can start small and scale as your application grows.",
